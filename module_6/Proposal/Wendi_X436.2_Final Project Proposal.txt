Working as a project manager in architect field, I am managing multiple tasks at the same time. Some tasks require others to begin, whereas some are free standing. I would like to write a program that can automatically sort out the sequence of working tasks for me.

It should take the duration, start date, requirement of each task, and check whether it requires other tasks to begin, or whether it has conflicts with other tasks, what special conditions it mush meet(such as the concrete wall has to be left dry for 28 days, during which time no other work should be conducted in that room for quality purpose). It will also be good to consider how much each task will contribute to the final look of the building, so that when time is running short, I can get rid of the unnecessary ones and focus on the more prosperous one.
