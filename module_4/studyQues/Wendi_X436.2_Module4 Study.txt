1. I changed the hasMoreelement function to return (m_ptr + 1) != 0 ; It gave me java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: -1.

2. I think if there needs to be communications between classes that is irrelevant to other classes, they can be put into the same package. If there is a component only relative to a certain class, but not the other classes in the same package, it is a better idea to put it as a nested class, which reduces confusion and is more safe.

3. There are some variables that can only be accessed by certain users or be changed only in the designed ways(like in a method).  Private variables allow such conditions to happen. Go all public is like green light on all directions, which has a higher chance to create bugs.

4. It could also be used to serve as methods of a class, which unlike constructor, returns stuff. Because of the type-safe feature of java, overloaded functions allow different types of input and goes beyond that, which allows for different numbers of input.
