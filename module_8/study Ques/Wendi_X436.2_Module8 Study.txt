1. I think using Socket class can make it happen.

2. File class provide the directory of that file. So we can get directory there. Besides, a file has only one directory, but in a directory there can be multiple files. If we have Directory class, not File class, it will make the manipulation of files more complicated.

Unfortunately I can not think of a better design. Any ideas?

3.InputStream-based classes takes data by byte, which can be used for image, sound data;
 Whereas Reader handles character well. If it is all text, then Reader is a good choice.
